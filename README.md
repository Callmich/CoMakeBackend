## What is CoMake?
It is a platform to give voice and visibility to communities on local issues occurring around them. My specific goal on the team was to design and implement a back-end relational database to be used by the React front-end team.


### Tech/Languages Used:
node.js | expres | javaScript | knex | sqlite3 | postgres | jest | jwt authorization

### Build Instructions for a Dev Server:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Callmich/CoMakeBackend.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd CoMakeBackend`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start server with `npm run server`
5. If SQLite3 is installed - run `knex migrate:latest` to set up database
