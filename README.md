Product Vision:    Co-Make 2
- What problem does your app solve? 
- allows local government agencies to connect with community
- gives other people in the community visibility to issues occurring around them
- recognizes community members for their contributions
 




- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- ties post to area(zip code, city) which allows it to be specific to where the issue is occurring 
- streamlines process of highlighting an issue that’s occurring in the community by allowing them to create a post directly on the app
- with ability to upvote allows for prioritization of those issues

- What is the mission statement? 
- Co-make 2 is dedicated to the highest quality of empowering the community by giving visibility to issues - delivered with thoughtfulness, understanding and care.
